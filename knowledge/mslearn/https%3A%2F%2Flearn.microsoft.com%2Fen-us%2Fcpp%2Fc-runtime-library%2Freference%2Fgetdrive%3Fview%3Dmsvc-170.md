Gets the current disk drive.

## Syntax

```
int _getdrive( void );
```

## Return value

Returns the current (default) drive (1=A, 2=B, and so on). A return value of zero means that the current path doesn't start with a letter drive name, such as a UNC path. Or, it means that an internal buffer allocation failed. If an internal allocation fails, `errno` is set to ENOMEM.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements

Routine

Required header

**`_getdrive`**

<direct.h>

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/compatibility?view=msvc-170).

## Example

```
// crt_getdrive.c
// Illustrates drive functions including:
//    _getdrive       _chdrive        _getdcwd
//

#include <stdio.h>
#include <direct.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main( void )
{
   int ch, drive, curdrive;
   static char path[_MAX_PATH];

   // Save current drive.
   curdrive = _getdrive();

   printf( "Available drives are:\n" );

   // If we can switch to the drive, it exists.
   for( drive = 1; drive <= 26; drive++ )
   {
      if( !_chdrive( drive ) )
      {
         printf( "%c:", drive + 'A' - 1 );
         if( _getdcwd( drive, path, _MAX_PATH ) != NULL )
            printf( " (Current directory is %s)", path );
         putchar( '\n' );
      }
   }

   // Restore original drive.
   _chdrive( curdrive );
}
```

```
Available drives are:
A: (Current directory is A:\)
C: (Current directory is C:\)
E: (Current directory is E:\testdir\bin)
F: (Current directory is F:\)
G: (Current directory is G:\)
```
