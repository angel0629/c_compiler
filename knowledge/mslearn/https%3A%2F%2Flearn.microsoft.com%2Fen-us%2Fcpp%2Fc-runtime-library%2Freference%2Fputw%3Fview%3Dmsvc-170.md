Writes an integer to a stream.

## Syntax

```
int _putw(
   int binint,
   FILE *stream
);
```

### Parameters

_`binint`_  
Binary integer to be output.

_`stream`_  
Pointer to the `FILE` structure.

## Return value

Returns the value written. A return value of `EOF` might indicate an error. Because `EOF` is also a legitimate integer value, use `ferror` to verify an error. If _`stream`_ is a null pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, this function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns `EOF`.

For information about these and other error codes, see [`errno`, `_doserrno`, `_sys_errlist`, and `_sys_nerr`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr?view=msvc-170).

The **`_putw`** function writes a binary value of type **`int`** to the current position of _stream._ **`_putw`** doesn't affect the alignment of items in the stream nor does it assume any special alignment. **`_putw`** is primarily for compatibility with previous libraries. Portability problems might occur with **`_putw`** because the size of an **`int`** and the ordering of bytes within an **`int`** differ across systems.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements

Routine

Required header

**`_putw`**

<stdio.h>

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/compatibility?view=msvc-170).

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crt-library-features?view=msvc-170).

## Example

```
// crt_putw.c
/* This program uses _putw to write a
* word to a stream, then performs an error check.
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main( void )
{
   FILE *stream;
   unsigned u;
   if( fopen_s( &stream, "data.out", "wb" ) )
      exit( 1 );
   for( u = 0; u < 10; u++ )
   {
      _putw( u + 0x2132, stream );   /* Write word to stream. */
      if( ferror( stream ) )         /* Make error check. */
      {
         printf( "_putw failed" );
         clearerr_s( stream );
         exit( 1 );
      }
   }
   printf( "Wrote ten words\n" );
   fclose( stream );
}
```

### Output

```
Wrote ten words
```
