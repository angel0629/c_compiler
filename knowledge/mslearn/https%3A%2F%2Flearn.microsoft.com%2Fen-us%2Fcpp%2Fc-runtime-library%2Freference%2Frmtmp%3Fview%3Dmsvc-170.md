Removes temporary files.

## Syntax

```
int _rmtmp( void );
```

## Return value

**`_rmtmp`** returns the number of temporary files closed and deleted.

## Remarks

The **`_rmtmp`** function cleans up all temporary files in the current directory. The function removes only those files created by `tmpfile`; use it only in the same directory in which the temporary files were created.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements

Required header
