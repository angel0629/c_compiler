## Syntax

```
#include <malloc.h>
```

## Remarks

These constants give the return value indicating status of the heap.

Constant

Meaning

`_HEAPBADBEGIN`

Initial header information wasn't found or was invalid.

`_HEAPBADNODE`

Bad node was found, or heap is damaged.

`_HEAPBADPTR`

`_pentry` field of `_HEAPINFO` structure doesn't contain valid pointer into heap (`_heapwalk` routine only).

`_HEAPEMPTY`

Heap hasn't been initialized.

`_HEAPEND`

End of heap was reached successfully (`_heapwalk` routine only).

`_HEAPOK`

Heap is consistent (`_heapset` and `_heapchk` routines only). No errors so far; `_HEAPINFO` structure contains information about next entry (`_heapwalk` routine only).
