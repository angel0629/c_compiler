Disables performance-critical locking in I/O operations.

## Syntax

```
#define _CRT_DISABLE_PERFCRIT_LOCKS
```

## Remarks

Defining this symbol can improve performance in single-threaded I/O-bound programs by forcing all I/O operations to assume a single-threaded I/O model. For more information, see [Multithreaded libraries performance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/multithreaded-libraries-performance?view=msvc-170).
