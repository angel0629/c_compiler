We encourage users to file bug reports for any problems that they encounter. We also welcome feature requests. When filing a bug report, please do the following:

*   Include the checker build (for prebuilt Mac OS X binaries) or the git hash.
    
*   Provide a self-contained, reduced test case that exhibits the issue you are experiencing.
    
*   Test cases don’t tell us everything. Please briefly describe the problem you are seeing, including what you thought should have been the expected behavior and why.
    

Please [file bugs and feature requests](https://llvm.org/docs/HowToSubmitABug.html) in [LLVM’s issue tracker](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues) and label the report with the `clang:static analyzer` label.
