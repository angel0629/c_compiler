Determines whether a particular character is a punctuation character.

## Syntax

```
int _ismbbpunct(
   unsigned int c
);
int _ismbbpunct_l(
   unsigned int c,
   _locale_t locale
);
```

### Parameters

_`c`_  
Integer to be tested.

_`locale`_  
Locale to use.

## Return value

**`_ismbbpunct`** returns a nonzero value if the integer _`c`_ is a non-ASCII punctuation symbol. **`_ismbbpunct`** uses the current locale for any locale-dependent character settings. **`_ismbbpunct_l`** is identical except that it uses the locale that's passed in. For more information, see [Locale](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/locale?view=msvc-170).

## Remarks

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements
