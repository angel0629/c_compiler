The Microsoft-specific function names `strnicmp` and `wcsnicmp` are deprecated aliases for the [`_strnicmp` and `_wcsnicmp`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strnicmp-wcsnicmp-mbsnicmp-strnicmp-l-wcsnicmp-l-mbsnicmp-l?view=msvc-170) functions. By default, they generate [Compiler warning (level 3) C4996](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-3-c4996?view=msvc-170). The names are deprecated because they don't follow the Standard C rules for implementation-specific names. However, the functions are still supported.

We recommend you use [`_strnicmp` and `_wcsnicmp`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strnicmp-wcsnicmp-mbsnicmp-strnicmp-l-wcsnicmp-l-mbsnicmp-l?view=msvc-170) instead. Or, you can continue to use these function names, and disable the warning. For more information, see [Turn off the warning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-3-c4996?view=msvc-170#turn-off-the-warning) and [POSIX function names](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-3-c4996?view=msvc-170#posix-function-names).
