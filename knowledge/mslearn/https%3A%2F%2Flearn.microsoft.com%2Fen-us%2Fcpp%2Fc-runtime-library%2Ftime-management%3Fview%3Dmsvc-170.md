Use these functions to get the current time and convert, adjust, and store it as necessary. The current time is the system time.

The **`_ftime`** and **`localtime`** routines use the **`TZ`** environment variable. If **`TZ`** isn't set, the run-time library attempts to use the time-zone information specified by the operating system. If this information is unavailable, these functions use the default value of PST8PDT. For more information on **`TZ`**, see [`_tzset`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/tzset?view=msvc-170); also see [`_daylight`, `timezone`, and `_tzname`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/daylight-dstbias-timezone-and-tzname?view=msvc-170).

Note

In all versions of Microsoft C/C++ except Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0, and in all versions of Visual C++, the time function returns the current time as the number of seconds elapsed since midnight on January 1, 1970. In Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0, **`time`** returned the current time as the number of seconds elapsed since midnight on December 31, 1899.

Note

In versions of Visual C++ and Microsoft C/C++ before Visual Studio 2005, **`time_t`** was a **`long int`** (32 bits) and hence could not be used for dates past 3:14:07 January 19, 2038, UTC. **`time_t`** is now equivalent to **`__time64_t`** by default, but defining `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T` changes **`time_t`** to **`__time32_t`** and forces many time functions to call versions that take the 32-bit **`time_t`**. For more information, see [Standard types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/standard-types?view=msvc-170) and comments in the documentation for the individual time functions.
