To simplify writing code for international markets, generic-text mappings are defined in TCHAR.H for:

*   [Data types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/data-type-mappings?view=msvc-170)
    
*   [Constants and global variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/constant-and-global-variable-mappings?view=msvc-170)
    
*   [Routine mappings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/routine-mappings?view=msvc-170)
    

For more information, see [Using generic-text mappings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/using-generic-text-mappings?view=msvc-170). Generic-text mappings are Microsoft extensions that aren't ANSI compatible.
