Tests _`c`_ for the `ctype` property specified by the _`desc`_ argument. For each valid value of _`desc`_, there's an equivalent wide-character classification routine.

## Syntax

```
int _isctype(
   int c,
   _ctype_t desc
);
int _isctype_l(
   int c,
   _ctype_t desc,
   _locale_t locale
);
int iswctype(
   wint_t c,
   wctype_t desc
);
int _iswctype_l(
   wint_t c,
   wctype_t desc,
   _locale_t locale
);
```

### Parameters

_`c`_  
Integer to test.

_`desc`_  
Property to test for. The property is normally retrieved using `ctype` or [`wctype`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/wctype?view=msvc-170).

_`locale`_  
The locale to use for any locale-dependent tests.

## Return value

**`_isctype`** and **`iswctype`** return a nonzero value if _`c`_ has the property specified by _`desc`_ in the current locale. Otherwise, they return 0. The versions of these functions with the `_l` suffix are identical except that they use the locale passed in instead of the current locale for their locale-dependent behavior. For more information, see [Locale](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/locale?view=msvc-170).

The behavior of **`_isctype`** and **`_isctype_l`** is undefined if _`c`_ isn't EOF or in the range 0 through 0xFF, inclusive. When a debug CRT library is used and _`c`_ isn't one of these values, the functions raise an assertion.

### Generic-text routine mappings

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).
