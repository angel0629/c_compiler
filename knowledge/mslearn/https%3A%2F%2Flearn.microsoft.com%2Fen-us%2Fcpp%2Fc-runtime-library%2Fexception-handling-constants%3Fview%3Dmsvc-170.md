The constant `EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH`, `EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION`, or `EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER` is returned when an exception occurs during execution of the guarded section of a **try-except** statement. The return value determines how the exception is handled. For more information, see [try-except Statement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/try-except-statement?view=msvc-170) in the _C++ Language Reference_.
