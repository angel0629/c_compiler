Determines whether an integer represents a graphical character.

## Syntax

```
int isgraph(
   int c
);
int iswgraph(
   wint_t c
);
int _isgraph_l(
   int c,
   _locale_t locale
);
int _iswgraph_l(
   wint_t c,
   _locale_t locale
);
```

### Parameters

_`c`_  
Integer to test.

## Return value

Each of these routines returns nonzero if _`c`_ is a particular representation of a printable character other than a space. **`isgraph`** returns a nonzero value if _`c`_ is a printable character other than a space. **`iswgraph`** returns a nonzero value if _`c`_ is a printable wide character other than a wide character space. Each of these routines returns 0 if _`c`_ doesn't satisfy the test condition.

The versions of these functions that have the `_l` suffix use the locale that's passed in instead of the current locale for their locale-dependent behavior. For more information, see [Locale](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/locale?view=msvc-170).

The behavior of **`isgraph`** and **`_isgraph_l`** is undefined if _`c`_ isn't EOF or in the range 0 through 0xFF, inclusive. When a debug CRT library is used and _`c`_ isn't one of these values, the functions raise an assertion.
