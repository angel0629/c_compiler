Determines whether a specified multibyte character is alpha.

## Syntax

```
int _ismbbalpha(
   unsigned int c
);
int _ismbbalpha_l(
   unsigned int c
);
```

### Parameters

_`c`_  
Integer to be tested.

_`locale`_  
Locale to use.

## Return value

**`_ismbbalpha`** returns a nonzero value when the expression:

`isalpha(c) || _ismbbkalnum(c)`

is nonzero for _`c`_, or 0 when the expression is zero. **`_ismbbalpha`** uses the current locale for any locale-dependent character settings. **`_ismbbalpha_l`** is identical except that it uses the locale passed in.

## Remarks

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements

Routine

Required header
