Unlocks a file, allowing other processes to access the file.

## Syntax

```
void _unlock_file(
   FILE* file
);
```

### Parameters

_`file`_  
File handle.

## Remarks

The **`_unlock_file`** function unlocks the file specified by _`file`_. Unlocking a file allows access to the file by other processes. This function shouldn't be called unless `_lock_file` was previously called on the _`file`_ pointer. Calling **`_unlock_file`** on a file that isn't locked may result in a deadlock. For an example, see [`_lock_file`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/lock-file?view=msvc-170).

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements
