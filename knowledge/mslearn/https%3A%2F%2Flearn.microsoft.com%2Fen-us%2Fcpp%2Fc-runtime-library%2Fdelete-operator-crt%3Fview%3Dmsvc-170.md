## In this article

Beginning in Visual Studio 2013, the Universal C Runtime (UCRT) no longer supports the C++-specific `operator new` and `operator delete` functions. These functions are now part of the C++ Standard Library. For more information, see [`new` and `delete` operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/new-and-delete-operators?view=msvc-170) and [`delete` operator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/delete-operator-cpp?view=msvc-170) in the C++ Language Reference.
