Returns the address of the current **`new`** handler routine.

## Syntax

```
_PNH _query_new_handler(
   void
);
```

## Return value

Returns the address of the current **`new`** handler routine as set by `_set_new_handler`.

## Remarks

The C++ **`_query_new_handler`** function returns the address of the current exception-handling function set by the C++ [`_set_new_handler`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/set-new-handler?view=msvc-170) function. `_set_new_handler` is used to specify an exception-handling function that is to gain control if the **`new`** operator fails to allocate memory. For more information, see the discussion of the [`new` and `delete` operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/new-and-delete-operators?view=msvc-170) in the C++ Language Reference.
