**Obsolete**. The maximum permissible string length for a time zone name variable. This macro was defined in <limits.h> in Visual Studio 2012 and earlier versions. It isn't defined in Visual Studio 2013 and later versions. To get the length required to hold the current time zone name, use [`_get_tzname`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/get-tzname?view=msvc-170).

## Syntax

```
#include <limits.h>
```
