These routines read and write on your console or on the specified port. The console I/O routines aren't compatible with stream I/O or low-level I/O library routines. The console or port doesn't have to be opened or closed before I/O is performed, so there are no open or close routines in this category. In the Windows operating systems, the output from these functions is always directed to the console and can't be redirected.

## Console and port I/O routines
