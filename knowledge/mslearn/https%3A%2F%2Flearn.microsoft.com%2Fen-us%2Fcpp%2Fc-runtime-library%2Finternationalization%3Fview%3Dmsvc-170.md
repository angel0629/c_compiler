The Microsoft runtime library provides many routines that you can use to customize your app for international markets such as:

*   [locale-related routines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/locale?view=msvc-170)
*   wide-character routines
*   multibyte-character routines
*   generic-text routines

For convenience, most locale-related routines are also categorized by what they do.

Multibyte routines and wide-character routines are described alongside their single-byte-character counterparts, when they exist.

ISO646 operator alternatives are also included.
