This section lists Universal C runtime (UCRT) library routines by category. For reference convenience, some routines are listed in more than one category. Multibyte-character routines and wide-character routines are grouped with single-byte character counterparts, where they exist.

## UCRT library routine categories

The main categories of UCRT library routines are:
