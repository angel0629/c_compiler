The Microsoft run-time library contains definitions for [global variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-variables?view=msvc-170), [control flags](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/control-flags?view=msvc-170), and [standard types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/standard-types?view=msvc-170) used by library routines. Access these variables, flags, and types by declaring them in your program or by including the appropriate header files.
