Many C run-time (CRT) APIs can't be used in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that execute in the Windows Runtime. These apps are built by using the /ZW compiler flag. For a list of unsupported CRT functions, see [CRT functions not supported in Universal Windows Platform apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cppcx/crt-functions-not-supported-in-universal-windows-platform-apps?view=msvc-170).

All CRT APIs are described in the [Alphabetical function reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/crt-alphabetical-function-reference?view=msvc-170) section of the documentation.
