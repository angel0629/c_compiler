Tests for an error on a stream.

## Syntax

```
int ferror(
   FILE *stream
);
```

### Parameters

_`stream`_  
Pointer to `FILE` structure.

## Return value

If no error has occurred on _`stream`_, **`ferror`** returns 0. Otherwise, it returns a nonzero value. If stream is `NULL`, **`ferror`** invokes the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, this function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns 0.

For more information about return codes, see [`errno`, `_doserrno`, `_sys_errlist`, and `_sys_nerr`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr?view=msvc-170).

The **`ferror`** routine (implemented both as a function and as a macro) tests for a reading or writing error on the file associated with _`stream`_. If an error has occurred, the error indicator for the stream remains set until the stream is closed or rewound, or until `clearerr` is called against it.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).
