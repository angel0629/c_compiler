Gets and sets the floating-point control word. A more secure version of **`_controlfp`** is available; see [`_controlfp_s`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/controlfp-s?view=msvc-170).

## Syntax

```
unsigned int _control87(
   unsigned int new,
   unsigned int mask
);
unsigned int _controlfp(
   unsigned int new,
   unsigned int mask
);
int __control87_2(
   unsigned int new,
   unsigned int mask,
   unsigned int* x86_cw,
   unsigned int* sse2_cw
);
```

### Parameters

_`new`_  
New control-word bit values.

_`mask`_  
Mask for new control-word bits to set.

_`x86_cw`_  
Filled in with the control word for the x87 floating-point unit. Pass in 0 (`NULL`) to set only the SSE2 control word.

_`sse2_cw`_  
Control word for the SSE floating-point unit. Pass in 0 (`NULL`) to set only the x87 control word.

## Return value

For **`_control87`** and **`_controlfp`**, the bits in the value returned indicate the floating-point control state. For a complete definition of the bits that are returned by **`_control87`**, see `FLOAT.H`.

For **`__control87_2`**, the return value is 1, which indicates success.

The **`_control87`** function gets and sets the floating-point control word. The floating-point control word enables the program to change the precision, rounding, and infinity modes, depending on the platform. You can also use **`_control87`** to mask or unmask floating-point exceptions. If the value for _`mask`_ is equal to 0, **`_control87`** gets the floating-point control word. If _`mask`_ is nonzero, a new value for the control word is set: For any bit that is on (that is, equal to 1) in _`mask`_, the corresponding bit in _`new`_ is used to update the control word. In other words, `fpcntrl = ((fpcntrl & ~mask) | (new & mask))` where **`fpcntrl`** is the floating-point control word.

Note

By default, the run-time libraries mask all floating-point exceptions.

**`_controlfp`** is a platform-independent, portable version of **`_control87`** that's nearly identical to the **`_control87`** function. If your code targets more than one platform, use **`_controlfp`** or **`_controlfp_s`**. The difference between **`_control87`** and **`_controlfp`** is in how they treat `DENORMAL` values. For x86, x64, ARM, and ARM64 platforms, **`_control87`** can set and clear the `DENORMAL OPERAND` exception mask. **`_controlfp`** doesn't modify the `DENORMAL OPERAND` exception mask. This example demonstrates the difference:

```
_control87( _EM_INVALID, _MCW_EM );
// DENORMAL is unmasked by this call
_controlfp( _EM_INVALID, _MCW_EM );
// DENORMAL exception mask remains unchanged
```

The possible values for the mask constant (_`mask`_) and new control values (_`new`_) are shown in the Control word masks and values table. Use the portable constants listed below (`_MCW_EM`, `_EM_INVALID`, and so forth) as arguments to these functions, rather than supplying the hexadecimal values explicitly.

Intel x86-derived platforms support the `DENORMAL` input and output values in hardware. The x86 behavior is to preserve `DENORMAL` values. The ARM and ARM64 platforms and the x64 platforms that have SSE2 support enable `DENORMAL` operands and results to be flushed, or forced to zero. The **`_controlfp`** and **`_control87`** functions provide a mask to change this behavior. The following example demonstrates the use of this mask.

```
_controlfp(_DN_SAVE, _MCW_DN);
// Denormal values preserved on ARM platforms and on x64 processors with
// SSE2 support. NOP on x86 platforms.
_controlfp(_DN_FLUSH, _MCW_DN);
// Denormal values flushed to zero by hardware on ARM platforms
// and x64 processors with SSE2 support. Ignored on other x86 platforms.
```

On ARM and ARM64 platforms, the **`_control87`** and **`_controlfp`** functions apply to the FPSCR register. Only the SSE2 control word that's stored in the MXCSR register is affected on x64 platforms. On x86 platforms, **`_control87`** and **`_controlfp`** affect the control words for both the x87 and the SSE2, if present.

The function **`__control87_2`** enables both the x87 and SSE2 floating-point units to be controlled together or separately. To affect both units, pass in the addresses of two integers to **`x86_cw`** and **`sse2_cw`**. If you only want to affect one unit, pass in an address for that parameter, but pass in 0 (`NULL`) for the other. If 0 is passed for one of these parameters, the function has no effect on that floating-point unit. It's useful when part of your code uses the x87 floating-point unit, and another part uses the SSE2 floating-point unit.

If you use **`__control87_2`** to set different values for the floating-point control words, then **`_control87`** or **`_controlfp`** might be unable to return a single control word to represent the state of both floating-point units. In such a case, these functions set the `EM_AMBIGUOUS` flag in the returned integer value to indicate an inconsistency between the two control words. The `EM_AMBIGUOUS` flag is a warning that the returned control word might not represent the state of both floating-point control words accurately.

On the ARM, ARM64, and x64 platforms, changing the infinity mode or the floating-point precision isn't supported. If the precision control mask is used on the x64 platform, the function raises an assertion, and the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170).

Note

**`__control87_2`** is not supported on the ARM, ARM64, or x64 platforms. If you use **`__control87_2`** and compile your program for the ARM, ARM64, or x64 platforms, the compiler generates an error.

These functions are ignored when you use [`/clr` (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation?view=msvc-170) to compile. The common language runtime (CLR) only supports the default floating-point precision.

### Control word masks and values

For the `_MCW_EM` mask, clearing the mask sets the exception, which allows the hardware exception; setting the mask hides the exception. If a `_EM_UNDERFLOW` or `_EM_OVERFLOW` occurs, no hardware exception is thrown until the next floating-point instruction is executed. To generate a hardware exception immediately after `_EM_UNDERFLOW` or `_EM_OVERFLOW`, call the `FWAIT` MASM instruction.

// processor: x86
// compile by using: cl /W4 /arch:IA32 crt_cntrl87.c
// This program uses __control87_2 to output the x87 control
// word, set the precision to 24 bits, and reset the status to
// the default.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <float.h>
#pragma fenv_access (on)

int main( void )
{
    double a = 0.1;
    unsigned int control_word_x87 = 0;
    int result;

    // Show original x87 control word and do calculation.
    result = __control87_2(0, 0, &control_word_x87, 0 );
    printf( "Original: 0x%.8x\n", control_word_x87 );
    printf( "%1.1f * %1.1f = %.15e\n", a, a, a * a );

    // Set precision to 24 bits and recalculate.
    result = __control87_2(_PC_24, MCW_PC, &control_word_x87, 0 );
    printf( "24-bit:   0x%.8x\n", control_word_x87 );
    printf( "%1.1f * %1.1f = %.15e\n", a, a, a * a );

    // Restore default precision-control bits and recalculate.
    result = __control87_2( _CW_DEFAULT, MCW_PC, &control_word_x87, 0 );
    printf( "Default:  0x%.8x\n", control_word_x87 );
    printf( "%1.1f * %1.1f = %.15e\n", a, a, a * a );
