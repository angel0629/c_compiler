Loads and executes new child processes.

## Syntax

```
intptr_t _execl(
   const char *cmdname,
   const char *arg0,
   ... const char *argn,
   NULL
);
intptr_t _wexecl(
   const wchar_t *cmdname,
   const wchar_t *arg0,
   ... const wchar_t *argn,
   NULL
);
```

### Parameters

_`cmdname`_  
Path of the file to be executed.

_`arg0`_, ... _`argN`_  
List of pointers to the parameters.

## Return value

If successful, these functions don't return to the calling process. A return value of -1 indicates an error, in which case the `errno` global variable is set.

`errno` value

Description

`E2BIG`

The space required for the arguments and environment settings exceeds 32 KB.

`EACCES`

The specified file has a locking or sharing violation.

`EINVAL`

Invalid parameter (one or more of the parameters was a null pointer or empty string).

`EMFILE`

Too many files open (the specified file must be opened to determine whether it's executable).

`ENOENT`

The file or path isn't found.

`ENOEXEC`

The specified file isn't executable or has an invalid executable-file format.

`ENOMEM`

Not enough memory is available to execute the new process; the available memory has been corrupted; or an invalid block exists, indicating that the calling process wasn't allocated properly.

Each of these functions loads and executes a new process, passing each command-line argument as a separate parameter. The first argument is the command or executable file name, and the second argument should be the same as the first. It becomes `argv[0]` in the executed process. The third argument is the first argument, `argv[1]`, of the process being executed.

The **`_execl`** functions validate their parameters. If either _`cmdname`_ or _`arg0`_ is a null pointer or empty string, these functions invoke the invalid parameter handler as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170) If execution is allowed to continue, these functions set `errno` to `EINVAL` and return -1. No new process is executed.
