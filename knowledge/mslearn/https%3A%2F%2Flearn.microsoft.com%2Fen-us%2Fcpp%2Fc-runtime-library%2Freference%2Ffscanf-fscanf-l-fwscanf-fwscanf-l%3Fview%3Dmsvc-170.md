Read formatted data from a stream. More secure versions of these functions are available; see [`fscanf_s`, `_fscanf_s_l`, `fwscanf_s`, `_fwscanf_s_l`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fscanf-s-fscanf-s-l-fwscanf-s-fwscanf-s-l?view=msvc-170).

## Syntax

```
int fscanf(
   FILE *stream,
   const char *format [,
   argument ]...
);
int _fscanf_l(
   FILE *stream,
   const char *format,
   _locale_t locale [,
   argument ]...
);
int fwscanf(
   FILE *stream,
   const wchar_t *format [,
   argument ]...
);
int _fwscanf_l(
   FILE *stream,
   const wchar_t *format,
   _locale_t locale [,
   argument ]...
);
```

### Parameters

_`stream`_  
Pointer to `FILE` structure.

_`format`_  
Format-control string.

_`argument`_  
Optional arguments.

_`locale`_  
The locale to use.

## Return value

Each of these functions returns the number of fields successfully converted and assigned; the return value doesn't include fields that were read but not assigned. A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned. If an error occurs, or if the end of the file stream is reached before the first conversion, the return value is `EOF` for **`fscanf`** and **`fwscanf`**.

These functions validate their parameters. If _`stream`_ or _`format`_ is a `NULL` pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return `EOF` and set `errno` to `EINVAL`.

The **`fscanf`** function reads data from the current position of _`stream`_ into the locations given by _`argument`_ (if any). Each _`argument`_ must be a pointer to a variable of a type that corresponds to a type specifier in _`format`_. _`format`_ controls the interpretation of the input fields and has the same form and function as the _`format`_ argument for **`scanf`**; see [`scanf`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/scanf-scanf-l-wscanf-wscanf-l?view=msvc-170) for a description of _`format`_.

**`fwscanf`** is a wide-character version of **`fscanf`**; the format argument to **`fwscanf`** is a wide-character string. These functions behave identically if the stream is opened in ANSI mode. **`fscanf`** doesn't currently support input from a UNICODE stream.

The versions of these functions with the **`_l`** suffix are identical except that they use the locale parameter passed in instead of the current thread locale.

## Example

```
// crt_fscanf.c
// compile with: /W3
// This program writes formatted
// data to a file. It then uses fscanf to
// read the various data back from the file.

#include <stdio.h>

FILE *stream;

int main( void )
{
   long l;
   float fp;
   char s[81];
   char c;

   if( fopen_s( &stream, "fscanf.out", "w+" ) != 0 )
      printf( "The file fscanf.out was not opened\n" );
   else
   {
      fprintf( stream, "%s %ld %f%c", "a-string",
               65000, 3.14159, 'x' );
      // Security caution!
      // Beware loading data from a file without confirming its size,
      // as it may lead to a buffer overrun situation.

      // Set pointer to beginning of file:
      fseek( stream, 0L, SEEK_SET );

      // Read data back from file:
      fscanf( stream, "%s", s );   // C4996
      fscanf( stream, "%ld", &l ); // C4996

      fscanf( stream, "%f", &fp ); // C4996
      fscanf( stream, "%c", &c );  // C4996
      // Note: fscanf is deprecated; consider using fscanf_s instead

      // Output data read:
      printf( "%s\n", s );
      printf( "%ld\n", l );
      printf( "%f\n", fp );
      printf( "%c\n", c );

      fclose( stream );
   }
}
```
