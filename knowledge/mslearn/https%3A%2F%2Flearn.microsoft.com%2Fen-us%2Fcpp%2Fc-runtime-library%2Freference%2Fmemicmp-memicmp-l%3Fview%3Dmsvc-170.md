Compares characters in two buffers (case-insensitive).

## Syntax

```
int _memicmp(
   const void *buffer1,
   const void *buffer2,
   size_t count
);
int _memicmp_l(
   const void *buffer1,
   const void *buffer2,
   size_t count,
   _locale_t locale
);
```

### Parameters

_`buffer1`_  
First buffer.

_`buffer2`_  
Second buffer.

_`count`_  
Number of characters.

_`locale`_  
Locale to use.

## Return value

The return value indicates the relationship between the buffers.

Return value

Relationship of first count bytes of buf1 and buf2

< 0

_`buffer1`_ less than _`buffer2`_.

0

_`buffer1`_ identical to _`buffer2`_.

\> 0

_`buffer1`_ greater than _`buffer2`_.

`_NLSCMPERROR`

An error occurred.

The **`_memicmp`** function compares the first _`count`_ characters of the two buffers _`buffer1`_ and _`buffer2`_ byte by byte. The comparison isn't case-sensitive.

If either _`buffer1`_ or _`buffer2`_ is a null pointer, this function invokes an invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, the function returns `_NLSCMPERROR` and sets `errno` to `EINVAL`.

**`_memicmp`** uses the current locale for locale-dependent behavior; **`_memicmp_l`** is identical except that it uses the locale passed in instead. For more information, see [Locale](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/locale?view=msvc-170).

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements

Routine

Required header

**`_memicmp`**

<memory.h> or <string.h>

**`_memicmp_l`**

<memory.h> or <string.h>

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/compatibility?view=msvc-170).

## Example

```
// crt_memicmp.c
// This program uses _memicmp to compare
// the first 29 letters of the strings named first and
// second without regard to the case of the letters.

#include <memory.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main( void )
{
   int result;
   char first[] = "Those Who Will Not Learn from History";
   char second[] = "THOSE WHO WILL NOT LEARN FROM their mistakes";
   // Note that the 29th character is right here ^

   printf( "Compare '%.29s' to '%.29s'\n", first, second );
   result = _memicmp( first, second, 29 );
   if( result < 0 )
      printf( "First is less than second.\n" );
   else if( result == 0 )
      printf( "First is equal to second.\n" );
   else if( result > 0 )
      printf( "First is greater than second.\n" );
}
```

```
Compare 'Those Who Will Not Learn from' to 'THOSE WHO WILL NOT LEARN FROM'
First is equal to second.
```
