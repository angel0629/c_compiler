Returns the termination routine to be called by `terminate`.

## Syntax

```
terminate_function _get_terminate( void );
```

## Return value

Returns a pointer to the function registered by [`set_terminate`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/set-terminate-crt?view=msvc-170). If no function has been set, the return value may be used to restore the default behavior; this value may be `NULL`.

## Remarks

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).
