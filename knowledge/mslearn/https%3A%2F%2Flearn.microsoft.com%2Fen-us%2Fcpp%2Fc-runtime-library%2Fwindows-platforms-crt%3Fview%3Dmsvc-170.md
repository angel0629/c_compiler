The C run-time libraries for Visual Studio support all versions of Windows and Windows Server that are still in extended support. Visual Studio 2015 supports Windows 8 and 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Vista. It optionally supports Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3) for x86, Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) for x64, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 (SP2) for both x86 and x64. All of these operating systems support the Windows desktop API (Win32) and provide Unicode support. In addition, any Win32 application can use a multibyte character set (MBCS).
