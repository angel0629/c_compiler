Stores the current floating-point environment in the specified object.

## Syntax

```
int fegetenv(
   fenv_t *penv
);
```

### Parameters

_`penv`_  
Pointer to an `fenv_t` object to contain the current floating-point environment values.

## Return value

Returns 0 if the floating-point environment was successfully stored in _`penv`_. Otherwise, it returns a non-zero value.

## Remarks

The **`fegetenv`** function stores the current floating-point environment in the object pointed to by _`penv`_. The floating point environment is the set of status flags and control modes that affect floating-point calculations. This environment includes the rounding direction mode and the status flags for floating-point exceptions. If _`penv`_ doesn't point to a valid `fenv_t` object, subsequent behavior is undefined.

To use this function, you must turn off floating-point optimizations that could prevent access by using the `#pragma fenv_access(on)` directive prior to the call. For more information, see [`fenv_access`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/fenv-access?view=msvc-170).
