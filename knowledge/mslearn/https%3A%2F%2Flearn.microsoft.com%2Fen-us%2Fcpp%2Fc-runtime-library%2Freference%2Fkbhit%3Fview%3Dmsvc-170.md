Checks the console for keyboard input.

## Syntax

```
int _kbhit( void );
```

## Return value

**`_kbhit`** returns a nonzero value if a key has been pressed. Otherwise, it returns 0.

## Remarks

The **`_kbhit`** function checks the console for a recent keystroke. If the function returns a nonzero value, a keystroke is waiting in the buffer. The program can then call **`_getch`** or **`_getche`** to get the keystroke.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements

Routine

Required header

**`_kbhit`**

`<conio.h>`

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/compatibility?view=msvc-170).

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crt-library-features?view=msvc-170).

## Example

```
// crt_kbhit.c
/* This program loops until the user
* presses a key. If _kbhit returns nonzero, a
* keystroke is waiting in the buffer. The program
* can call _getch or _getche to get the keystroke.
*/

#include <conio.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main( void )
{
   /* Display message until key is pressed. */
   while( !_kbhit() )
      _cputs( "Hit me!! " );

   /* Use _getch to throw key away. */
   printf( "\nKey struck was '%c'\n", _getch() );
}
```

### Sample output

```
Hit me!! Hit me!! Hit me!! Hit me!! Hit me!! Hit me!! Hit me!!
Key struck was 'q'
```
