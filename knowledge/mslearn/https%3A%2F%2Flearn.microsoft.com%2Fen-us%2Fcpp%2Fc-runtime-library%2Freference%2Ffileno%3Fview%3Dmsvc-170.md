Gets the file descriptor associated with a stream.

## Syntax

```
int _fileno(
   FILE *stream
);
```

### Parameters

_`stream`_  
Pointer to the `FILE` structure.

## Return value

**`_fileno`** returns the file descriptor. There's no error return. The result is undefined if _`stream`_ doesn't specify an open file. If stream is `NULL`, **`_fileno`** invokes the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, this function returns -1 and sets `errno` to `EINVAL`.

For more information about these and other error codes, see [`errno`, `_doserrno`, `_sys_errlist`, and `_sys_nerr`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr?view=msvc-170).

Note

If **`stdout`** or **`stderr`** is not associated with an output stream (for example, in a Windows application without a console window), the file descriptor returned is -2. In previous versions, the file descriptor returned was -1. This change allows applications to distinguish this condition from an error.

The **`_fileno`** routine returns the file descriptor currently associated with _`stream`_. This routine is implemented both as a function and as a macro. For information about choosing either implementation, see [Recommendations for choosing between functions and macros](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/recommendations-for-choosing-between-functions-and-macros?view=msvc-170).

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements

Function

Required header

**`_fileno`**

`<stdio.h>`

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/compatibility?view=msvc-170).

## Example

```
// crt_fileno.c
// This program uses _fileno to obtain
// the file descriptor for some standard C streams.
//

#include <stdio.h>

int main( void )
{
   printf( "The file descriptor for stdin is %d\n", _fileno( stdin ) );
   printf( "The file descriptor for stdout is %d\n", _fileno( stdout ) );
   printf( "The file descriptor for stderr is %d\n", _fileno( stderr ) );
}
```

```
The file descriptor for stdin is 0
The file descriptor for stdout is 1
The file descriptor for stderr is 2
```
