Constants for file-sharing modes.

## Syntax

```
#include <share.h>
```

## Remarks

The _`shflag`_ argument determines the sharing mode, which consists of one or more manifest constants. These constants can be combined with the _`oflag`_ arguments (see [File constants](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/file-constants?view=msvc-170)).

The following table lists the constants and their meanings:
