Reads formatted data from a stream. These versions of vfscanf, vfwscanf have security enhancements, as described in [Security features in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt?view=msvc-170).

## Syntax

```
int vfscanf_s(
   FILE *stream,
   const char *format,
   va_list arglist
);
int vfwscanf_s(
   FILE *stream,
   const wchar_t *format,
   va_list arglist
);
```

### Parameters

_`stream`_  
Pointer to `FILE` structure.

_`format`_  
Format-control string.

_`arglist`_  
Variable argument list.

## Return value

Each of these functions returns the number of fields that are successfully converted and assigned. The return value doesn't include fields that were read but not assigned. A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned. If an error occurs, or if the end of the file stream is reached before the first conversion, the return value is `EOF` for **`vfscanf_s`** and **`vfwscanf_s`**.

These functions validate their parameters. If _`stream`_ is an invalid file pointer, or _`format`_ is a null pointer, these functions invoke the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return `EOF` and set `errno` to `EINVAL`.

The **`vfscanf_s`** function reads data from the current position of _`stream`_ into the locations that are given by the _`arglist`_ argument list (if any). Each argument in the list must be a pointer to a variable of a type that corresponds to a type specifier in _`format`_. _`format`_ controls the interpretation of the input fields and has the same form and function as the _`format`_ argument for `scanf_s`; see [Format specification fields: `scanf` and `wscanf` functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/format-specification-fields-scanf-and-wscanf-functions?view=msvc-170) for a description of _`format`_. **`vfwscanf_s`** is a wide-character version of **`vfscanf_s`**; the format argument to **`vfwscanf_s`** is a wide-character string. These functions behave identically if the stream is opened in ANSI mode. **`vfscanf_s`** doesn't currently support input from a UNICODE stream.

The main difference between the more secure functions (that have the **`_s`** suffix) and the other versions is that the more secure functions require the size in characters of each **`c`**, **`C`**, **`s`**, **`S`**, and **`[`** type field to be passed as an argument immediately following the variable. For more information, see [`scanf_s`, `_scanf_s_l`, `wscanf_s`, `_wscanf_s_l`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/scanf-s-scanf-s-l-wscanf-s-wscanf-s-l?view=msvc-170) and [`scanf` width specification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/scanf-width-specification?view=msvc-170).

Note

The size parameter is of type **`unsigned`**, not `size_t`.

## Example

```
// crt_vfscanf_s.c
// compile with: /W3
// This program writes formatted
// data to a file. It then uses vfscanf_s to
// read the various data back from the file.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

FILE *stream;

int call_vfscanf_s(FILE * istream, char * format, ...)
{
    int result;
    va_list arglist;
    va_start(arglist, format);
    result = vfscanf_s(istream, format, arglist);
    va_end(arglist);
    return result;
}

int main(void)
{
    long l;
    float fp;
    char s[81];
    char c;

    if (fopen_s(&stream, "vfscanf_s.out", "w+") != 0)
    {
        printf("The file vfscanf_s.out was not opened\n");
    }
    else
    {
        fprintf(stream, "%s %ld %f%c", "a-string",
            65000, 3.14159, 'x');
        // Security caution!
        // Beware loading data from a file without confirming its size,
        // as it may lead to a buffer overrun situation.

        // Set pointer to beginning of file:
        fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET);

        // Read data back from file:
        call_vfscanf_s(stream, "%s %ld %f%c", s, _countof(s), &l, &fp, &c, 1);

        // Output data read:
        printf("%s\n", s);
        printf("%ld\n", l);
        printf("%f\n", fp);
        printf("%c\n", c);

        fclose(stream);
    }
}
```

```
