Traverses the heap and returns information about the next entry.

## Syntax

```
int _heapwalk( _HEAPINFO *entryinfo );
```

### Parameters

_`entryinfo`_  
Buffer to contain heap information.

## Return value

**`_heapwalk`** returns one of the following integer manifest constants defined in Malloc.h.

Return value

Meaning

`_HEAPBADBEGIN`

Initial header information invalid or not found.

`_HEAPBADNODE`

Heap damaged or bad node found.

`_HEAPBADPTR`

The `_pentry` field of the `_HEAPINFO` structure doesn't contain a valid pointer into the heap or _`entryinfo`_ is a null pointer.

`_HEAPEND`

End of the heap reached successfully.

`_HEAPEMPTY`

Heap not initialized.

`_HEAPOK`

No errors so far; _`entryinfo`_ is updated with information about the next heap entry.

In addition, if an error occurs, **`_heapwalk`** sets `errno` to `ENOSYS`.

The **`_heapwalk`** function helps debug heap-related problems in programs. The function walks through the heap, traversing one entry per call, and returns a pointer to a structure of type `_HEAPINFO` that contains information about the next heap entry. The `_HEAPINFO` type, defined in Malloc.h, contains the following elements.

Field

Meaning

`int *_pentry`

Heap entry pointer.

`size_t _size`

Size of the heap entry.

`int _useflag`

Flag that indicates whether the heap entry is in use.

A call to **`_heapwalk`** that returns `_HEAPOK` stores the size of the entry in the `_size` field and sets the `_useflag` field to either `_FREEENTRY` or `_USEDENTRY` (both are constants defined in Malloc.h). To obtain this information about the first entry in the heap, pass **`_heapwalk`** a pointer to a `_HEAPINFO` structure whose `_pentry` member is `NULL`. If the operating system doesn't support **`_heapwalk`**, the function returns `_HEAPEND` and sets `errno` to `ENOSYS`.

This function validates its parameter. If _`entryinfo`_ is a null pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, `errno` is set to `EINVAL` and the function returns `_HEAPBADPTR`.

## Requirements

## Example

```
// crt_heapwalk.c

// This program "walks" the heap, starting
// at the beginning (_pentry = NULL). It prints out each
// heap entry's use, location, and size. It also prints
// out information about the overall state of the heap as
// soon as _heapwalk returns a value other than _HEAPOK
// or if the loop has iterated 100 times.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <malloc.h>

void heapdump(void);

int main(void)
{
    char *buffer;

    heapdump();
    if((buffer = (char *)malloc(59)) != NULL)
    {
        heapdump();
        free(buffer);
    }
    heapdump();
}

void heapdump(void)
{
    _HEAPINFO hinfo;
    int heapstatus;
    int numLoops;
    hinfo._pentry = NULL;
    numLoops = 0;
    while((heapstatus = _heapwalk(&hinfo)) == _HEAPOK &&
          numLoops < 100)
    {
        printf("%8s block at %Fp of size %4.4X\n",
               (hinfo._useflag == _USEDENTRY ? "USED" : "FREE"),
               hinfo._pentry, hinfo._size);
        numLoops++;
    }

    switch(heapstatus)
    {
    case _HEAPEMPTY:
        printf("OK - empty heap\n");
        break;
    case _HEAPEND:
        printf("OK - end of heap\n");
        break;
    case _HEAPBADPTR:
        printf("ERROR - bad pointer to heap\n");
        break;
    case _HEAPBADBEGIN:
        printf("ERROR - bad start of heap\n");
        break;
    case _HEAPBADNODE:
        printf("ERROR - bad node in heap\n");
        break;
    }
}
