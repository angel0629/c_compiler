Determines whether an integer represents a printable character.

## Syntax

```
int isprint(
   int c
);
int iswprint(
   wint_t c
);
int _isprint_l(
   int c,
   _locale_t locale
);
int _iswprint_l(
   wint_t c,
   _locale_t locale
);
```

### Parameters

_`c`_  
Integer to test.

_`locale`_  
The locale to use.

## Return value

Each of these routines returns nonzero if _`c`_ is a particular representation of a printable character. **`isprint`** returns a nonzero value if _`c`_ is a printable character (0x20 - 0x7E), including the space character. **`iswprint`** returns a nonzero value if _`c`_ is a printable wide character, including the space wide character. Each of these routines returns 0 if _`c`_ doesn't satisfy the test condition.

The result of the test condition for these functions depends on the `LC_CTYPE` category setting of the locale. For more information, see [`setlocale`, `_wsetlocale`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/setlocale-wsetlocale?view=msvc-170). The versions of these functions that don't have the `_l` suffix use the current locale for any locale-dependent behavior; the versions that do have the `_l` suffix are identical except that they use the locale that's passed in instead. For more information, see [Locale](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/locale?view=msvc-170).

The behavior of **`isprint`** and **`_isprint_l`** is undefined if _`c`_ isn't EOF or in the range 0 through 0xFF, inclusive. When a debug CRT library is used and _`c`_ isn't one of these values, the functions raise an assertion.

### Generic-text routine mappings

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).
