Performs context-sensitive tests for multibyte-character-string lead bytes and trail bytes and determines whether a given substring pointer points to a lead byte or a trail byte.

## Syntax

```
int _ismbslead(
   const unsigned char *str,
   const unsigned char *current
);
int _ismbstrail(
   const unsigned char *str,
   const unsigned char *current
);
int _ismbslead_l(
   const unsigned char *str,
   const unsigned char *current,
   _locale_t locale
);
int _ismbstrail_l(
   const unsigned char *str,
   const unsigned char *current,
   _locale_t locale
);
```

### Parameters

_`str`_  
Pointer to the start of the string or the previous known lead byte.

_`current`_  
Pointer to the position in the string to be tested.

_`locale`_  
The locale to use.

## Return value

**`_ismbslead`** returns -1 if the character is a lead byte and **`_ismbstrail`** returns -1 if the character is a trail byte. If the input strings are valid but aren't a lead byte or trail byte, these functions return zero. If either argument is `NULL`, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return `NULL` and set `errno` to `EINVAL`.

**`_ismbslead`** and **`_ismbstrail`** are slower than the **`_ismbblead`** and **`_ismbbtrail`** versions because they take the string context into account.

The versions of these functions that have the `_l` suffix are identical except that for their locale-dependent behavior they use the locale that's passed in instead of the current locale. For more information, see [Locale](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/locale?view=msvc-170).

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).
