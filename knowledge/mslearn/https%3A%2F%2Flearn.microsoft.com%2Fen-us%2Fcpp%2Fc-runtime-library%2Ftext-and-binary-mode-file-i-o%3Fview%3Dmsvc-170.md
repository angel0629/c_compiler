File I/O operations take place in one of two translation modes, _text_ or _binary_, depending on the mode in which the file is opened. Data files are often processed in text mode. To control the file translation mode, one can:

*   Retain the current default setting and specify the alternative mode only when you open selected files.
    
*   Use the function [`_set_fmode`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/set-fmode?view=msvc-170) to change the default mode for newly opened files. Use [`_get_fmode`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/get-fmode?view=msvc-170) to find the current default mode. The initial default setting is ANSI text mode (`_O_TEXT`).
    
*   Change the default translation mode directly by setting the global variable [`_fmode`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/fmode?view=msvc-170) in your program. The function `_set_fmode` sets the value of this variable, but it can also be set directly.
    

When you call a file-open function such as [`_open`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/open-wopen?view=msvc-170), [`fopen`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fopen-wfopen?view=msvc-170), [`fopen_s`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fopen-s-wfopen-s?view=msvc-170), [`freopen`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/freopen-wfreopen?view=msvc-170), [`freopen_s`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/freopen-s-wfreopen-s?view=msvc-170), [`_fsopen`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fsopen-wfsopen?view=msvc-170) or [`_sopen_s`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/sopen-s-wsopen-s?view=msvc-170), you can override the current default setting of `_fmode` by specifying the appropriate argument to the function [`_set_fmode`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/set-fmode?view=msvc-170). The `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` streams always open in text mode by default; you can also override this default when opening any of these files. Use [`_setmode`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/setmode?view=msvc-170) to change the translation mode using the file descriptor after the file is open.
