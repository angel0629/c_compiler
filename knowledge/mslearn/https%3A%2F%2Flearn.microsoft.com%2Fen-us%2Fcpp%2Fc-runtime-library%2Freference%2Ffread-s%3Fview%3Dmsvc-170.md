Reads data from a stream. This version of [`fread`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fread?view=msvc-170) has security enhancements, as described in [Security features in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt?view=msvc-170).

## Syntax

```
size_t fread_s(
   void *buffer,
   size_t bufferSize,
   size_t elementSize,
   size_t count,
   FILE *stream
);
```

### Parameters

_`buffer`_  
Storage location for data.

_`bufferSize`_  
Size of the destination buffer in bytes.

_`elementSize`_  
Size of the item to read in bytes.

_`count`_  
Maximum number of items to be read.

_`stream`_  
Pointer to `FILE` structure.

## Return value

**`fread_s`** returns the number of (whole) items that were read into the buffer, which may be less than _`count`_ if a read error or the end of the file is encountered before _`count`_ is reached. Use the **`feof`** or **`ferror`** function to distinguish an error from an end-of-file condition. If _`size`_ or _`count`_ is 0, **`fread_s`** returns 0 and the buffer contents are unchanged. If _`stream`_ or _`buffer`_ is a null pointer, **`fread_s`** invokes the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, this function sets `errno` to `EINVAL` and returns 0.

For more information about error codes, see [`errno`, `_doserrno`, `_sys_errlist`, and `_sys_nerr`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr?view=msvc-170).

The **`fread_s`** function reads up to _`count`_ items of _`elementSize`_ bytes from the input _`stream`_ and stores them in _`buffer`_. The file pointer that's associated with _`stream`_ (if there's one) is advanced by the number of bytes **`fread_s`** read. If the given stream is opened in text mode, carriage return-line feed pairs are replaced with single line feed characters. The replacement has no effect on the file pointer or the return value. The file-pointer position is indeterminate if an error occurs. The value of a partially read item can't be determined.

This function locks out other threads. If you require a non-locking version, use **`_fread_nolock`**.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Example

```
// crt_fread_s.c
// Command line: cl /EHsc /nologo /W4 crt_fread_s.c
//
// This program opens a file that's named FREAD.OUT and
// writes characters to the file. It then tries to open
// FREAD.OUT and read in characters by using fread_s. If the attempt succeeds,
// the program displays the number of actual items read.

#include <stdio.h>

#define BUFFERSIZE 30
#define DATASIZE 22
#define ELEMENTCOUNT 2
#define ELEMENTSIZE (DATASIZE/ELEMENTCOUNT)
#define FILENAME "FREAD.OUT"

int main( void )
{
   FILE *stream;
   char list[30];
   int  i, numread, numwritten;

   for ( i = 0; i < DATASIZE; i++ )
      list[i] = (char)('z' - i);
   list[DATASIZE] = '\0'; // terminal null so we can print it

   // Open file in text mode:
   if( fopen_s( &stream, FILENAME, "w+t" ) == 0 )
   {
      // Write DATASIZE characters to stream
      printf( "Contents of buffer before write/read:\n\t%s\n\n", list );
      numwritten = fwrite( list, sizeof( char ), DATASIZE, stream );
      printf( "Wrote %d items\n\n", numwritten );
      fclose( stream );
   } else {
      printf( "Problem opening the file\n" );
      return -1;
   }

   if( fopen_s( &stream, FILENAME, "r+t" ) == 0 )   {
      // Attempt to read in characters in 2 blocks of 11
      numread = fread_s( list, BUFFERSIZE, ELEMENTSIZE, ELEMENTCOUNT, stream );
      printf( "Number of %d-byte elements read = %d\n\n", ELEMENTSIZE, numread );
      printf( "Contents of buffer after write/read:\n\t%s\n", list );
      fclose( stream );
   } else {
      printf( "File could not be opened\n" );
      return -1;
   }
}
```

```
Contents of buffer before write/read:
        zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfe

Wrote 22 items

Number of 11-byte elements read = 2

Contents of buffer after write/read:
        zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfe
```
