Get the current time. More secure versions of these functions are available; see [`_ftime_s`, `_ftime32_s`, `_ftime64_s`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/ftime-s-ftime32-s-ftime64-s?view=msvc-170).

## Syntax

```
void _ftime( struct _timeb *timeptr );
void _ftime32( struct __timeb32 *timeptr );
void _ftime64( struct __timeb64 *timeptr );
```

### Parameters

_`timeptr`_  
Pointer to a `_timeb`, `__timeb32`, or `__timeb64` structure.

The **`_ftime`** function gets the current local time and stores it in the structure pointed to by _`timeptr`_. The `_timeb`, `__timeb32`, and `__timeb64` structures are defined in <sys\\timeb.h>. They contain four fields, which are listed in the following table.

Field

Description

`dstflag`

Nonzero if daylight savings time is currently in effect for the local time zone. (See [`_tzset`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/tzset?view=msvc-170) for an explanation of how daylight savings time is determined.)

`millitm`

Fraction of a second in milliseconds.

`time`

Time in seconds since midnight (00:00:00), January 1, 1970, coordinated universal time (UTC).

`timezone`

Difference in minutes, moving westward, between UTC and local time. The value of `timezone` is set from the value of the global variable `_timezone` (see `_tzset`).

The **`_ftime64`** function, which uses the `__timeb64` structure, allows file-creation dates to be expressed up through 23:59:59, December 31, 3000, UTC; whereas **`_ftime32`** only represents dates through 23:59:59 January 18, 2038, UTC. Midnight, January 1, 1970, is the lower bound of the date range for all these functions.

The **`_ftime`** function is equivalent to **`_ftime64`**, and `_timeb` contains a 64-bit time unless `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T` is defined, in which case the old behavior is in effect; **`_ftime`** uses a 32-bit time and `_timeb` contains a 32-bit time.

**`_ftime`** validates its parameters. If passed a null pointer as _`timeptr`_, the function invokes the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, the function sets `errno` to `EINVAL`.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements

Function

Required header

**`_ftime`**

<sys/types.h> and <sys/timeb.h>

**`_ftime32`**

<sys/types.h> and <sys/timeb.h>

**`_ftime64`**

<sys/types.h> and <sys/timeb.h>

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/compatibility?view=msvc-170).

## Example

```
// crt_ftime.c
// compile with: /W3
// This program uses _ftime to obtain the current
// time and then stores this time in timebuffer.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/timeb.h>
#include <time.h>

int main( void )
{
   struct _timeb timebuffer;
   char timeline[26];
   errno_t err;
   time_t time1;
   unsigned short millitm1;
   short timezone1;
   short dstflag1;

   _ftime( &timebuffer ); // C4996
   // Note: _ftime is deprecated; consider using _ftime_s instead

   time1 = timebuffer.time;
   millitm1 = timebuffer.millitm;
   timezone1 = timebuffer.timezone;
   dstflag1 = timebuffer.dstflag;

   printf( "Seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 (UTC): %I64d\n",
   time1);
   printf( "Milliseconds: %d\n", millitm1);
   printf( "Minutes between UTC and local time: %d\n", timezone1);
   printf( "Daylight savings time flag (1 means Daylight time is in "
           "effect): %d\n", dstflag1);

   err = ctime_s( timeline, 26, & ( timebuffer.time ) );
   if (err)
   {
       printf("Invalid argument to ctime_s. ");
   }
   printf( "The time is %.19s.%hu %s", timeline, timebuffer.millitm,
           &timeline[20] );
}
```

```
Seconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 (UTC): 1051553334
Milliseconds: 230
Minutes between UTC and local time: 480
Daylight savings time flag (1 means Daylight time is in effect): 1
The time is Mon Apr 28 11:08:54.230 2003
```
