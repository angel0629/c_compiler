Closes a file.

## Syntax

```
int _close(
   int fd
);
```

### Parameters

_`fd`_  
File descriptor referring to the open file.

## Return value

**`_close`** returns 0 if the file was successfully closed. A return value of -1 indicates an error.

## Remarks

The **`_close`** function closes the file associated with _`fd`_.

The file descriptor and the underlying OS file handle are closed. Thus, it isn't necessary to call `CloseHandle` if the file was originally opened using the Win32 function `CreateFile` and converted to a file descriptor using `_open_osfhandle`.

This function validates its parameters. If _`fd`_ is a bad file descriptor, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, the functions returns -1 and `errno` is set to `EBADF`.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).
