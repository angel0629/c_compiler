## Syntax

```
#include <math.h>
```

## Remarks

The math routines of the run-time library can generate math error constants.

These errors, described as follows, correspond to the exception types defined in MATH.H and are returned by the `_matherr` function when a math error occurs.

Constant

Meaning

`_DOMAIN`

Argument to function is outside domain of function.

`_OVERFLOW`

Result is too large to be represented in function's return type.

`_PLOSS`

Partial loss of significance occurred.

`_SING`

Argument singularity: argument to function has illegal value. (For example, value 0 is passed to function that requires nonzero value.)

`_TLOSS`

Total loss of significance occurred.

`_UNDERFLOW`

Result is too small to be represented.
