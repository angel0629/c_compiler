Get status information on a file.

## Syntax

```
int _stat(
   const char *path,
   struct _stat *buffer
);
int _stat32(
   const char *path,
   struct __stat32 *buffer
);
int _stat64(
   const char *path,
   struct __stat64 *buffer
);
int _stati64(
   const char *path,
   struct _stati64 *buffer
);
int _stat32i64(
   const char *path,
   struct _stat32i64 *buffer
);
int _stat64i32(
   const char *path,
   struct _stat64i32 *buffer
);
int _wstat(
   const wchar_t *path,
   struct _stat *buffer
);
int _wstat32(
   const wchar_t *path,
   struct __stat32 *buffer
);
int _wstat64(
   const wchar_t *path,
   struct __stat64 *buffer
);
int _wstati64(
   const wchar_t *path,
   struct _stati64 *buffer
);
int _wstat32i64(
   const wchar_t *path,
   struct _stat32i64 *buffer
);
int _wstat64i32(
   const wchar_t *path,
   struct _stat64i32 *buffer
);
```

### Parameters

_`path`_  
Pointer to a string containing the path of existing file or directory.

_`buffer`_  
Pointer to structure that stores results.

## Return value

Each of these functions returns 0 if the file-status information is obtained. A return value of -1 indicates an error, in which case `errno` is set to `ENOENT`, indicating that the filename or path couldn't be found. A return value of `EINVAL` indicates an invalid parameter; `errno` is also set to `EINVAL` in this case.

For more information about return codes, see [`errno`, `_doserrno`, `_sys_errlist`, and `_sys_nerr`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr?view=msvc-170).

The date stamp on a file can be represented if it's later than midnight, January 1, 1970, and before 23:59:59, December 31, 3000, UTC, unless you use **`_stat32`** or **`_wstat32`**, or have defined `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T`, in which case the date can be represented only until 23:59:59 January 18, 2038, UTC.

The **`_stat`** function obtains information about the file or directory specified by _`path`_ and stores it in the structure pointed to by _`buffer`_. **`_stat`** automatically handles multibyte-character string arguments as appropriate, recognizing multibyte-character sequences according to the multibyte code page currently in use.

**`_wstat`** is a wide-character version of **`_stat`**; the _`path`_ argument to **`_wstat`** is a wide-character string. **`_wstat`** and **`_stat`** behave identically except that **`_wstat`** doesn't handle multibyte-character strings.

Variations of these functions support 32-bit or 64-bit time types, and 32-bit or 64-bit file lengths. The first numerical suffix (**`32`** or **`64`**) indicates the size of the time type used; the second suffix is either **`i32`** or **`i64`**, indicating whether the file size is represented as a 32-bit or 64-bit integer.

**`_stat`** is equivalent to **`_stat64i32`**, and **`struct _stat`** contains a 64-bit time, unless `_USE_32BIT_TIME_T` is defined, in which case the old behavior is in effect; **`_stat`** uses a 32-bit time, and **`struct _stat`** contains a 32-bit time. The same is true for **`_stati64`**.

Note

**`_wstat`** does not work with Windows Vista symbolic links. In these cases, **`_wstat`** will always report a file size of 0. **`_stat`** does work correctly with symbolic links. The `_stat` family of functions use `CreateFile` in Visual Studio 2015, instead of `FindFirstFile` as in Visual Studio 2013 and earlier. This means that `_stat` on a path ending with a slash succeeds if the path refers to a directory, as opposed to before when the function would error with `errno` set to `ENOENT`.

This function validates its parameters. If either _`path`_ or _`buffer`_ is `NULL`, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170).

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

The **`_stat`** structure, defined in **`SYS\STAT.H`**, includes the following fields.

Field

Description

**`st_gid`**

Numeric identifier of group that owns the file (UNIX-specific) This field will always be zero on Windows systems. A redirected file is classified as a Windows file.

**`st_atime`**

Time of last access of file. Valid on NTFS but not on FAT formatted disk drives.

**`st_ctime`**

Time of creation of file. Valid on NTFS but not on FAT formatted disk drives.

**`st_dev`**

Drive number of the disk containing the file (same as **`st_rdev`**).

**`st_ino`**

Number of the information node (the **`inode`**) for the file (UNIX-specific). On UNIX file systems, the **`inode`** describes the file date and time stamps, permissions, and content. When files are hard-linked to one another, they share the same **`inode`**. The **`inode`**, and therefore **`st_ino`**, has no meaning in the FAT, HPFS, or NTFS file systems.

**`st_mode`**

Bit mask for file-mode information. The `_S_IFDIR` bit is set if _`path`_ specifies a directory; the `_S_IFREG` bit is set if _`path`_ specifies an ordinary file or a device. User read/write bits are set according to the file's permission mode; user execute bits are set according to the filename extension.

**`st_mtime`**

Time of last modification of file.

**`st_nlink`**

Always 1 on non-NTFS file systems.

**`st_rdev`**

Drive number of the disk containing the file (same as **`st_dev`**).

**`st_size`**

Size of the file in bytes; a 64-bit integer for variations with the **`i64`** suffix.

**`st_uid`**

Numeric identifier of user who owns file (UNIX-specific). This field will always be zero on Windows systems. A redirected file is classified as a Windows file.

If _`path`_ refers to a device, the **`st_size`**, various time fields, **`st_dev`**, and **`st_rdev`** fields in the **`_stat`** structure are meaningless. Because **`STAT.H`** uses the [`_dev_t`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/standard-types?view=msvc-170) type that is defined in **`TYPES.H`**, you must include **`TYPES.H`** before **`STAT.H`** in your code.

         exit(1);
