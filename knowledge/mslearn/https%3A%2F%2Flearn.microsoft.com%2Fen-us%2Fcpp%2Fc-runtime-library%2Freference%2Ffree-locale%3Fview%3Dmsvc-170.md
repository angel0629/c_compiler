Frees a locale object.

## Syntax

```
void _free_locale(
   _locale_t locale
);
```

### Parameters

_`locale`_  
Locale object to free.

## Remarks

The **`_free_locale`** function is used to free the locale object obtained from a call to `_get_current_locale` or `_create_locale`.

The previous name of this function, **`__free_locale`** (with two leading underscores) has been deprecated.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements

`Routine`

Required header

**`_free_locale`**
