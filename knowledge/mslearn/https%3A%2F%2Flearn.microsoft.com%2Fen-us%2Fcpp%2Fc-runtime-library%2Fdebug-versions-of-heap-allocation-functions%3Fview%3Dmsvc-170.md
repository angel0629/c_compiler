The C runtime (CRT) library contains special Debug versions of the heap allocation functions. These functions have the same names as the Release versions with `_dbg` appended to them. This article describes the differences between the Release version of a CRT function and the `_dbg` version, using `malloc` and `_malloc_dbg` as examples.

## Behavior in debug builds

When [`_DEBUG`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/debug?view=msvc-170) is defined, the CRT maps all [`malloc`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/malloc?view=msvc-170) calls to [`_malloc_dbg`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/malloc-dbg?view=msvc-170). Therefore, you don't need to rewrite your code using `_malloc_dbg` instead of `malloc` to receive the benefits while debugging.

You might want to call `_malloc_dbg` explicitly, however. Calling `_malloc_dbg` explicitly has some added benefits:

*   Tracking `_CLIENT_BLOCK` type allocations.
    
*   Storing the source file and line number where the allocation request occurred.
    

If you don't want to convert your `malloc` calls to `_malloc_dbg`, you can obtain the source file information by defining [`_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crtdbg-map-alloc?view=msvc-170), which causes the preprocessor to directly map all calls to `malloc` to `_malloc_dbg` instead of relying on a wrapper around `malloc`.

To track the separate types of allocations in client blocks, you must call `_malloc_dbg` directly and set the `blockType` parameter to `_CLIENT_BLOCK`.

## Behavior in non-debug builds

When `_DEBUG` isn't defined, calls to `malloc` aren't disturbed, calls to `_malloc_dbg` are resolved to `malloc`, the definition of [`_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crtdbg-map-alloc?view=msvc-170) is ignored, and source file information pertaining to the allocation request isn't provided. Because `malloc` doesn't have a block type parameter, requests for `_CLIENT_BLOCK` types are treated as standard allocations.
