Causes normal program termination to occur.

## Syntax

```
__declspec(noreturn) void quick_exit(
    int status
);
```

### Parameters

_`status`_  
The status code to return to the host environment.

## Return value

The **`quick_exit`** function can't return to its caller.

The **`quick_exit`** function causes normal program termination. It calls no functions registered by `atexit`, `_onexit` or signal handlers registered by the `signal` function. Behavior is undefined if **`quick_exit`** is called more than once, or if the `exit` function is also called.

The **`quick_exit`** function calls, in last-in, first-out (LIFO) order, the functions registered by `at_quick_exit`, except for those functions already called when the function was registered. Behavior is undefined if a [`longjmp`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/longjmp?view=msvc-170) call is made during a call to a registered function that would terminate the call to the function.

After the registered functions have been called, **`quick_exit`** invokes `_Exit` by using the _`status`_ value to return control to the host environment.

## Requirements

Routine

Required header

**`quick_exit`**

<process.h> or <stdlib.h>
