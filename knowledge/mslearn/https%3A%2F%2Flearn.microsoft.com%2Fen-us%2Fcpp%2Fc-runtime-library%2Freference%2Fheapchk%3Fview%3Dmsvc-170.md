Runs consistency checks on the heap.

## Syntax

```
int _heapchk( void );
```

## Return value

**`_heapchk`** returns one of the following integer manifest constants defined in Malloc.h.

Return value

Condition

`_HEAPBADBEGIN`

Initial header information is bad or can't be found.

`_HEAPBADNODE`

Bad node has been found or heap is damaged.

`_HEAPBADPTR`

Pointer into heap isn't valid.

`_HEAPEMPTY`

Heap hasn't been initialized.

`_HEAPOK`

Heap appears to be consistent.

In addition, if an error occurs, **`_heapchk`** sets `errno` to `ENOSYS`.

The **`_heapchk`** function helps debug heap-related problems by checking for minimal consistency of the heap. If the operating system doesn't support **`_heapchk`** (for example, Windows 98), the function returns `_HEAPOK` and sets `errno` to `ENOSYS`.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements

Routine

Required header

Optional header

**`_heapchk`**

<malloc.h>

<errno.h>

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/compatibility?view=msvc-170).

## Example

```
// crt_heapchk.c
// This program checks the heap for
// consistency and prints an appropriate message.

#include <malloc.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main( void )
{
   int  heapstatus;
   char *buffer;

   // Allocate and deallocate some memory
   if( (buffer = (char *)malloc( 100 )) != NULL )
      free( buffer );

   // Check heap status
   heapstatus = _heapchk();
   switch( heapstatus )
   {
   case _HEAPOK:
      printf(" OK - heap is fine\n" );
      break;
   case _HEAPEMPTY:
      printf(" OK - heap is empty\n" );
      break;
   case _HEAPBADBEGIN:
      printf( "ERROR - bad start of heap\n" );
      break;
   case _HEAPBADNODE:
      printf( "ERROR - bad node in heap\n" );
      break;
   }
}
```

```
OK - heap is fine
```
