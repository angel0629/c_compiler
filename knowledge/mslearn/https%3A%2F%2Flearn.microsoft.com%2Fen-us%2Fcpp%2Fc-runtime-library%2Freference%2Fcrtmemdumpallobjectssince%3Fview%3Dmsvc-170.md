Dumps information about objects in the heap from the start of program execution or from a specified heap state (debug version only).

## Syntax

```
void _CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince(
   const _CrtMemState *state
);
```

### Parameters

_`state`_  
Pointer to the heap state to begin dumping from or `NULL`.

The **`_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince`** function dumps the debug header information of objects allocated in the heap in a user-readable form. The dump information can be used by the application to track allocations and detect memory problems. When [`_DEBUG`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/debug?view=msvc-170) isn't defined, calls to **`_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince`** are removed during preprocessing.

**`_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince`** uses the value of the _`state`_ parameter to determine where to initiate the dump operation. To begin dumping from a specified heap state, the _`state`_ parameter must be a pointer to a `_CrtMemState` structure that has been filled in by [`_CrtMemCheckpoint`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/crtmemcheckpoint?view=msvc-170) before **`_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince`** was called. When _`state`_ is `NULL`, the function begins the dump from the start of program execution.

If the application has installed a dump hook function by calling [`_CrtSetDumpClient`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/crtsetdumpclient?view=msvc-170), then every time **`_CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince`** dumps information about a `_CLIENT_BLOCK` type of block, it calls the application-supplied dump function as well. By default, internal C run-time blocks (`_CRT_BLOCK`) aren't included in memory dump operations. The [`_CrtSetDbgFlag`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/crtsetdbgflag?view=msvc-170) function can be used to turn on the `_CRTDBG_CHECK_CRT_DF` bit of `_crtDbgFlag` to include these blocks. In addition, blocks marked as freed or ignored (`_FREE_BLOCK`, `_IGNORE_BLOCK`) aren't included in the memory dump.

For more information about heap state functions and the `_CrtMemState` structure, see [Heap state reporting functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crt-debug-heap-details?view=msvc-170#heap-state-reporting-functions). For more information about how memory blocks are allocated, initialized, and managed in the debug version of the base heap, see [CRT debug heap details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crt-debug-heap-details?view=msvc-170).
