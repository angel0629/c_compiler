Repositions the file pointer to the beginning of a file.

## Syntax

```
void rewind(
   FILE *stream
);
```

### Parameters

_`stream`_  
Pointer to `FILE` structure.

The **`rewind`** function repositions the file pointer associated with _`stream`_ to the beginning of the file. A call to **`rewind`** is similar to

`(void) fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET );`

However, unlike [`fseek`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fseek-fseeki64?view=msvc-170), **`rewind`** clears both the error indicators for the stream and the end-of-file indicator. Also, unlike [`fseek`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/fseek-fseeki64?view=msvc-170), **`rewind`** doesn't return a value to indicate whether the pointer was successfully moved.

To clear the keyboard buffer, use **`rewind`** with the stream `stdin`, which is associated with the keyboard by default.

If stream is a `NULL` pointer, the invalid parameter handler is invoked, as described in [Parameter validation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/parameter-validation?view=msvc-170). If execution is allowed to continue, this function returns, and `errno` is set to `EINVAL`.

For information on these and other error codes, see [`errno`, `_doserrno`, `_sys_errlist`, and `_sys_nerr`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/errno-doserrno-sys-errlist-and-sys-nerr?view=msvc-170).

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).

## Requirements

Routine

Required header

**`rewind`**

<stdio.h>

For more compatibility information, see [Compatibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/compatibility?view=msvc-170).

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crt-library-features?view=msvc-170).

## Example

```
// crt_rewind.c
/* This program first opens a file named
* crt_rewind.out for input and output and writes two
* integers to the file. Next, it uses rewind to
* reposition the file pointer to the beginning of
* the file and reads the data back in.
*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main( void )
{
   FILE *stream;
   int data1, data2;

   data1 = 1;
   data2 = -37;

   fopen_s( &stream, "crt_rewind.out", "w+" );
   if( stream != NULL )
   {
      fprintf( stream, "%d %d", data1, data2 );
      printf( "The values written are: %d and %d\n", data1, data2 );
      rewind( stream );
      fscanf_s( stream, "%d %d", &data1, &data2 );
      printf( "The values read are: %d and %d\n", data1, data2 );
      fclose( stream );
   }
}
```

### Output

```
The values written are: 1 and -37
The values read are: 1 and -37
```
