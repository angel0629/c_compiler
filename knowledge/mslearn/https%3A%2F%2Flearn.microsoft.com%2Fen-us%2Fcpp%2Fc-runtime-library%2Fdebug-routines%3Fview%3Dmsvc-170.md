The debug version of the C runtime library supplies many diagnostic services that make debugging programs easier and allow developers to:

*   Step directly into run-time functions during debugging
    
*   Resolve assertions, errors, and exceptions
    
*   Trace heap allocations and prevent memory leaks
    
*   Report debug messages to the user
    

## Debug versions of the C runtime library routines

To use these routines, the [`_DEBUG`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/debug?view=msvc-170) flag must be defined. All of these routines do nothing in a retail build of an application. For more information on how to use the new debug routines, see [CRT debugging techniques](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crt-debugging-techniques?view=msvc-170).

## C runtime routines that aren't available in source code form

The debugger can be used to step through the source code for most of the C runtime routines during the debugging process. However, Microsoft considers some technology to be proprietary and, therefore, doesn't provide the source code for a subset of these routines. Most of these routines belong to either the exception handling or floating-point processing groups, but a few others are included as well. The following table lists these routines.

Although source code is available for most of the `printf` and `scanf` routines, they make an internal call to another routine for which source code isn't provided.

## Routines that behave differently in a debug build of an application

Some C run-time functions and C++ operators behave differently when called from a debug build of an application. (You can create a debug build of an application by either defining the `_DEBUG` flag or by linking with a debug version of the C run-time library.) The behavioral differences usually consist of extra features or information provided by the routine to support the debugging process. The following table lists these routines.

C++ [`new`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/new-operator-cpp?view=msvc-170) operator
