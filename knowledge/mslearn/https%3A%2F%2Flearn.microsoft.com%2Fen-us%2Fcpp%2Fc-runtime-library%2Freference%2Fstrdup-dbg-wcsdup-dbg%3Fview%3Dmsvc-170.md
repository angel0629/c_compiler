Versions of [`_strdup` and `_wcsdup`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strdup-wcsdup-mbsdup?view=msvc-170) that use the debug version of `malloc`.

## Syntax

```
char *_strdup_dbg(
   const char *strSource,
   int blockType,
   const char *filename,
   int linenumber
);
wchar_t *_wcsdup_dbg(
   const wchar_t *strSource,
   int blockType,
   const char *filename,
   int linenumber
);
```

### Parameters

_`strSource`_  
Null-terminated source string.

_`blockType`_  
Requested type of memory block: `_CLIENT_BLOCK` or `_NORMAL_BLOCK`.

_`filename`_  
Pointer to name of source file that requested allocation operation or `NULL`.

_`linenumber`_  
Line number in source file where allocation operation was requested or `NULL`.

## Return value

Each of these functions returns a pointer to the storage location for the copied string or `NULL` if storage can't be allocated.

The **`_strdup_dbg`** and **`_wcsdup_dbg`** functions are identical to `_strdup` and `_wcsdup` except that, when `_DEBUG` is defined, these functions use the debug version of `malloc`, `_malloc_dbg`, to allocate memory for the duplicated string. For information on the debugging features of `_malloc_dbg`, see [`_malloc_dbg`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/malloc-dbg?view=msvc-170).

You don't need to call these functions explicitly in most cases. Instead, you can define the flag `_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC`. When `_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC` is defined, calls to `_strdup` and `_wcsdup` are remapped to **`_strdup_dbg`** and **`_wcsdup_dbg`**, respectively, with the _`blockType`_ set to `_NORMAL_BLOCK`. Thus, you don't need to call these functions explicitly unless you want to mark the heap blocks as `_CLIENT_BLOCK`. For more information on block types, see [Types of blocks on the debug heap](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crt-debug-heap-details?view=msvc-170#types-of-blocks-on-the-debug-heap).
