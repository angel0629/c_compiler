## Syntax

```

The _`mode`_ argument in the call to the `_locking` function specifies the locking action to be performed.

The _`mode`_ argument must be one of the following manifest constants.

Value

Same as `_LK_LOCK`.

`_LK_NBLCK`

Locks the specified bytes. If bytes can't be locked, the function returns an error.

`_LK_NBRLCK`
