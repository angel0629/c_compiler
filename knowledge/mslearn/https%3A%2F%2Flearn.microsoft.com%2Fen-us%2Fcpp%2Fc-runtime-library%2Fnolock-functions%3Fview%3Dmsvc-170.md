The `_nolock` functions are versions of I/O functions that don't perform any locking. They're provided for users requiring maximum performance. For more information, see [Multithreaded libraries performance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/multithreaded-libraries-performance?view=msvc-170).

Use `_nolock` functions only if your program is truly single-threaded or if it does its own locking.

## No lock routines
