Sets the floating-point control word.

## Syntax

```
void __cdecl _set_controlfp(
    unsigned int newControl,
    unsigned int mask
);
```

### Parameters

_`newControl`_  
New control-word bit values.

_`mask`_  
Mask for new control-word bits to set.

## Return value

None.

## Remarks

The **`_set_controlfp`** function is similar to `_control87`, but it only sets the floating-point control word to _`newControl`_. The bits in the values indicate the floating-point control state. The floating-point control state allows the program to change the precision, rounding, and infinity modes in the floating-point math package. You can also mask or unmask floating-point exceptions using **`_set_controlfp`**. For more information, see [`_control87`, `_controlfp`, `__control87_2`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/control87-controlfp-control87-2?view=msvc-170).

This function is deprecated when compiling with [/clr (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation?view=msvc-170) because the common language runtime only supports the default floating-point precision.
