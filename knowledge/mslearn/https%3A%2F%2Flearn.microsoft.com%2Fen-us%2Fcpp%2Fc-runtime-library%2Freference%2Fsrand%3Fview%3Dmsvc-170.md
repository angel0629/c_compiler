Sets the starting seed value for the pseudorandom number generator used by the **`rand`** function.

## Syntax

```
void srand(
   unsigned int seed
);
```

### Parameters

_`seed`_  
Seed for pseudorandom number generation

## Remarks

The **`srand`** function sets the starting point for generating a series of pseudorandom integers in the current thread. To reinitialize the generator to create the same sequence of results, call the **`srand`** function and use the same _`seed`_ argument again. Any other value for _`seed`_ sets the generator to a different starting point in the pseudorandom sequence. **`rand`** retrieves the pseudorandom numbers that are generated. Calling **`rand`** before any call to **`srand`** generates the same sequence as calling **`srand`** with _`seed`_ passed as 1.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).
