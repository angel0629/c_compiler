Compares characters in two buffers.

## Syntax

```
int memcmp(
   const void *buffer1,
   const void *buffer2,
   size_t count
);
int wmemcmp(
   const wchar_t * buffer1,
   const wchar_t * buffer2,
   size_t count
);
```

### Parameters

_`buffer1`_  
First buffer.

_`buffer2`_  
Second buffer.

_`count`_  
Number of characters to compare. (Compares bytes for **`memcmp`**, wide characters for **`wmemcmp`**).

## Return value

The return value indicates the relationship between the buffers.

Return value

Relationship of first _`count`_ characters of `buf1` and `buf2`

< 0

_`buffer1`_ less than _`buffer2`_

0

_`buffer1`_ identical to _`buffer2`_

\> 0

_`buffer1`_ greater than _`buffer2`_

Compares the first _`count`_ characters of _`buffer1`_ and _`buffer2`_ and returns a value that indicates their relationship. The sign of a non-zero return value is the sign of the difference between the first differing pair of values in the buffers. The values are interpreted as **`unsigned char`** for **`memcmp`**, and as **`wchar_t`** for **`wmemcmp`**.

## Requirements

Routine

Required header

**`memcmp`**

`<memory.h>` or `<string.h>`

**`wmemcmp`**

`<wchar.h>`

## Libraries

All versions of the [C run-time library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crt-library-features?view=msvc-170).

## Example

```
// crt_memcmp.c
/* This program uses memcmp to compare
* the strings named first and second. If the first
* 19 bytes of the strings are equal, the program
* considers the strings to be equal.
*/

#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main( void )
{
   char first[]  = "12345678901234567890";
   char second[] = "12345678901234567891";
   int int_arr1[] = {1,2,3,4};
   int int_arr2[] = {1,2,3,4};
   int result;

   printf( "Compare '%.19s' to '%.19s':\n", first, second );
   result = memcmp( first, second, 19 );
   if( result < 0 )
      printf( "First is less than second.\n" );
   else if( result == 0 )
      printf( "First is equal to second.\n" );
   else
      printf( "First is greater than second.\n" );

   printf( "Compare '%d,%d' to '%d,%d':\n", int_arr1[0], int_arr1[1], int_arr2[0], int_arr2[1]);
   result = memcmp( int_arr1, int_arr2, sizeof(int) * 2 );
   if( result < 0 )
      printf( "int_arr1 is less than int_arr2.\n" );
   else if( result == 0 )
      printf( "int_arr1 is equal to int_arr2.\n" );
   else
      printf( "int_arr1 is greater than int_arr2.\n" );
}
```

```
Compare '1234567890123456789' to '1234567890123456789':
First is equal to second.
Compare '1,2' to '1,2':
int_arr1 is equal to int_arr2.
```
