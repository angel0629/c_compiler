[Console and port I/O](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/console-and-port-i-o?view=msvc-170) functions read or write directly to a console (keyboard and screen) or an I/O port (such as a printer port).

Note

Because stream functions are buffered and low-level functions are not, these two types of functions are generally incompatible. For processing a particular file, use either stream or low-level functions exclusively.
