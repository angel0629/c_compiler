## Syntax

```
#include <stdio.h>
```

## Remarks

These constants specify the mode of translation (**"b"** or **"t"**). The mode is included in the string specifying the type of access (**"r"**, **"w"**, **"a"**, **"r+"**, **"w+"**, **"a+"**).

The translation modes are as follows:

*   **t**
    
    Opens in text (translated) mode. In this mode, carriage return-line feed (CR-LF) combinations are translated into single line feeds (LF) on input, and LF characters are translated into CR-LF combinations on output. Also, CTRL+Z is interpreted as an end-of-file character on input. In files opened for reading or reading and writing, `fopen` checks for CTRL+Z at the end of the file and removes it, if possible. It's removed because using the `fseek` and `ftell` functions to move within a file ending with CTRL+Z may cause `fseek` to behave improperly near the end of the file.
    
    Note
    
    The **t** option is not part of the ANSI standard for `fopen` and `freopen`. It is a Microsoft extension and should not be used where ANSI portability is desired.
    
*   **b**
    
    Opens in binary (untranslated) mode. The above translations are suppressed.
    

If **t** or **b** isn't given in _`mode`_, the translation mode is defined by the default-mode variable [`_fmode`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/fmode?view=msvc-170). For more information about using text and binary modes, see [Text and binary mode file I/O](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/text-and-binary-mode-file-i-o?view=msvc-170).
