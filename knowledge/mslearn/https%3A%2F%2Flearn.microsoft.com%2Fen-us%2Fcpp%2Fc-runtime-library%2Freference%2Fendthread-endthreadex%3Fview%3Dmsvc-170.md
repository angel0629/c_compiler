Terminates a thread; **`_endthread`** terminates a thread that's created by **`_beginthread`** and **`_endthreadex`** terminates a thread that's created by **`_beginthreadex`**.

## Syntax

```
void _endthread( void );
void _endthreadex(
   unsigned retval
);
```

### Parameters

_`retval`_  
Thread exit code.

You can call **`_endthread`** or **`_endthreadex`** explicitly to terminate a thread; however, **`_endthread`** or **`_endthreadex`** is called automatically when the thread returns from the routine passed as a parameter to **`_beginthread`** or **`_beginthreadex`**. Terminating a thread with a call to **`endthread`** or **`_endthreadex`** helps ensure proper recovery of resources allocated for the thread.

Note

For an executable file linked with Libcmt.lib, do not call the Win32 [`ExitThread`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-exitthread) API; this prevents the run-time system from reclaiming allocated resources. **`_endthread`** and **`_endthreadex`** reclaim allocated thread resources and then call `ExitThread`.

**`_endthread`** automatically closes the thread handle. (This behavior differs from the Win32 `ExitThread` API.) Therefore, when you use **`_beginthread`** and **`_endthread`**, don't explicitly close the thread handle by calling the Win32 [`CloseHandle`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle) API.

Like the Win32 `ExitThread` API, **`_endthreadex`** doesn't close the thread handle. Therefore, when you use **`_beginthreadex`** and **`_endthreadex`**, you must close the thread handle by calling the Win32 `CloseHandle` API.

Note

**`_endthread`** and **`_endthreadex`** cause C++ destructors pending in the thread not to be called.

By default, this function's global state is scoped to the application. To change this behavior, see [Global state in the CRT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/global-state?view=msvc-170).
